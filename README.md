# Week10
Analog Clock | What time is it? It's Polar Coordinate Time, of course.

## 📃 Description:
Moving past reading time as figures, let's depict it as analog clock with hands [H : M : S].

## ✨ What to do:
- Study polar coordinates | Recommended watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5wjXoFrau4) video
- Let you map just one of the hands, seconds for instance, as a hand. Use sin (), cos ()

## 💡 Where to start? (Ideas)
- Click **[here](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week10/blob/main/WeeklyCoder_Week10.pde)** to get this week's starting code.

## 🥨 Twists
- Could you make the hands move smoothly (just like this (https://t.me/WeeklyCoder/21?comment=81) video)?
- How about using some APIs or hardcoding time differences to depict World Clock with Multiple Time Zones?

## Recommended Learning:
```
    Recommended Learning:
    - sin (), cos (), map (), dist (), constrain (), lerp ()
    - radians ()
```

## ⏳ Submissions:
- Submission of this challenge, just like all of the Weekly Coder’s challenges, is to be within 36 hours after post. And so, [here](https://t.me/WeeklyCoder/16) Sunday morning 12:00 LT.
