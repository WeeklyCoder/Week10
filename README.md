# Week10
Analog Clock | What time is it? It's Polar Coordinate Time, of course.

## 📃 Description:
Moving past reading time as figures, let's depict it as analog clock with hands [H : M : S].

## ✨ What to do:
- Study polar coordinates | Recommended watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5wjXoFrau4) video
- Let you map just one of the hands, seconds for instance, as a hand. Use sin (), cos ()
